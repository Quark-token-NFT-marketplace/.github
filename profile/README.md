# Intro to our project and what we are building
Most of our repos are private, but we will share information as we see necessary and good for the whole project & community.

## Quark token & NFT Marketplace 
The Quark token is an ERC20 token on Alveychain. It is the start and utility token of our ecosystem, which fuels the use of our product. 

## Our mission
Quark token is building one of the first NFT Marketplaces on Alveychain. Building an userfriendly and professional userinterface.

## Token & LP locker
Quark token has already developed a Token- & LP-lock on the Alveychain Blockchain. Currently working on a bot that is used for Alveychain communities.

## Marketplace
The Marketplace has a 0-2% dev and marketing fee. There will be a Quark token burn function where you can get 0% fees from all future mints if you participate in the burn feature that we will implement.
